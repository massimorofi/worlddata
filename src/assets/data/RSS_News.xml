To this end, if there’s one thing Democrats (and the media) want you to know about the anti-lockdown protest at the Michigan state capitol in Lansing last week, it’s that people were flying Confederate flags.“What happened yesterday was inexcusable,�? Representative Debbie Dingell (D., Mich.) said. “People did not have masks. They didn’t have gloves. They did not distance themselves. They had Confederate flags, swastikas.�?Governor Gretchen Whitmer scolded, “When people are flying the Confederate flag and untold numbers who gassed up on the way here or grabbed a bite on the way home — we know that this rally endangered people.�?The idea that they “had swastikas,�? as Dingell said, is meant to mislead. A few protesters, in particular a widely photographed woman with a “Heil Witmer�? (sic) sign, used swastikas to depict the governor as a fascist (obviously, a ridiculously over-the-top charge), not to identify themselves as Nazis.More broadly, any political protest will draw its share of nuts and fringe types. But that a couple of zealots displayed Confederate flags at this event involving as many as 4,000 people isn’t the first, second, or third thing to know about the protest, which can be more accurately described as lavishly star-spangled.You can watch long stretches of footage of the protests and see only a panorama of American flags — people flying them from their cars, waving them, draping themselves in them, displaying them on their wheelchairs. Many of the protesters are decked out in red-white-and-blue regalia.This long-form local news report doesn’t capture any Confederate flags at all.This drone footage is from an altitude that makes it difficult to see anything in detail, but gives an idea of the scale of the protest. Only the stars-and-stripes and “Don’t Tread On Me�? yellow are readily evident.This long video of someone from their car also captures no Confederate flags.This nearly hourlong video from the Detroit Free Press is dotted with American flags throughout, from beginning to end.Trump flags and “Don’t Tread On Me&amp;quot; flags are also notable.Near the beginning, the Detroit Free Press video does show one Confederate flag, a man with the Stars-and-Bars emblazoned with a rifle and the words “come and get it.�? That’s it. One idiot. Despite the video capturing hundreds of people in their cars and on the street and capitol grounds at the height of the protest.All of this suggests that you could have spent hours at this protest and have seen no Confederate flags whatsoever.What you would see is myriad signs saying things like “Land of the free,�? “Proud health care worker / Social distancing? Yes / Tyranny? No,�? “Balance the risk!,�? “Give us back our freedom�? (displayed on the back of a wheelchair), “Free Michigan,�? “My rights are essential,�? and in a big banner planted in the ground outside the capitol building, “Security without freedom is prison.�?In interviews with protesters, you’ll hear some crackpot theories, but largely people saying we’ve got to get back to work.This woman holding a “Small business is essential�? sign at 30:40 expresses the basic point of view quite well:Yet the Confederate flag featured prominently in news coverage. “Fox News host defended anti-lockdown protesters carrying Confederate flags and falsely accused Michigan&amp;#39;s governor of calling them Nazis�? read a (misleading) headline in Business Insider.The subhead of a Times of Israel article was “Some compare Gretchen Whitmer to Hitler, wave Confederate flags; governor accuses protesters of endangering themselves and the community.�?

The point, though, is you have to go out of your way to scour the record in painstaking detail to find them amid a vast sea of American flags.It’s entirely legitimate, obviously, to disagree with the anti-lockdown protests and to think they are wrong to want to open up now.

            <title>Renters still left out in the cold despite temporary coronavirus protection</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.yahoo.com/renters-still-left-cold-despite-121014391.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://l.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/_eiKErdtyoT_hYJQa6LyWQ--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_conversation_us_articles_815/c5f7b6b6433df22b3dc8f2591bb78ee4" width="130" height="86" alt="Renters still left out in the cold despite temporary coronavirus protection" align="left" title="Renters still left out in the cold despite temporary coronavirus protection" border="0" &gt;&lt;/a&gt;Emergency relief for renters across America may protect them from the threat of eviction during the coronavirus crisis – but it won’t last for long.The economic shutdown necessitated by COVID-19 has undermined the ability of millions of families and individuals to pay their landlords. But current measures to alleviate their hardship will not last through the summer, leaving the country at risk of a surge of evictions and homelessness within months.The current crisis also hits landlords, small ones especially, who may now struggle to meet mortgage payments, property taxes and other essential expenses. Again, the measures offered by Congress provide only limited relief.As scholars of housing policy, we know that for any measure to have real impact, it will need to address problems facing both tenants and landlords. Such a solution may already exist in the Housing Choice Voucher program, a 40-year-old program which enables low-income households to afford rental housing in the private market. Rental crisisThe coronavirus worsens an already severe housing affordability crisis. The most recent data shows that 10.7 million households, one-quarter of all renters, spend more than half of their income on rent, including 56% of all renters earning less than US$30,000 per year. More than 2.3 million renters are evicted annually. On any given night, more than 500,000 people are homeless, and nearly three times as many went homeless during the course of a single year.More than 20 million people have filed for unemployment benefits since the shutdown began, and this number is likely to climb higher in the weeks ahead.The people most at risk of losing their jobs are those who work in low-paying service industries such as restaurants, hotels, personal services and the retail sector. They are also disproportionately likely to rent their homes.Many of these workers will struggle to pay landlords in the coming months. As of 2019, the Federal Reserve reported that about 40% of all households could not cover an unexpected $400 expense without borrowing funds or selling a possession. In an effort to provide relief to families and business hit by the economic meltdown, President Trump signed the $2.2 trillion CARES Act on March 27. Stay of evictionThe legislation provides considerable support to homeowners but much less to renters. Homeowners with government-supported mortgages such as those that are guaranteed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, accounting for 70% of all outstanding mortgages, can skip mortgage payments for up to 12 months without risk of foreclosure. Missed payments will instead by added to their mortgage balances.Renters are afforded some protection. The legislation forbids private and public owners of rental housing financed with government assistance – about 28% of all rentals – from evicting tenants for nonpayment of rent over a period of six months. In addition to the CARES Act, 15 states and 24 cities have temporarily suspended evictions for nearly all renters in their jurisdictions.The CARES Act also provides relief in the shape of expanded unemployment benefits as well as a one-off payment of $1,200 to eligible adults and an extra $500 per child.But rental protection is unlikely to last more than a few months – less if stays on eviction are not enforced, as has been the case in a number of states.Moreover, when renters skip their rent, they still owe it – it will need to be repaid at a later date.These emergency measures do little to help landlords cover their expenses. It does prohibit lenders from foreclosing on landlords with federally backed mortgages, should they fail to make payment. But it does nothing to help them pay employees, utility bills or their property taxes. And when landlords cannot pay property taxes, it becomes even more difficult for hard-pressed cities, towns and school districts to provide essential services. Room for improvement?One alternative would be for the government to pay landlords directly to cover the loss of rental income. Rep. Ilhan Omar, for example, is proposing that all renters have their rents canceled, with landlords applying for compensation from the federal government. A downside of this approach is the potential for providing assistance to landlords and tenants who do not need it. It would also require a new apparatus to administer the program, which could delay implementation.Advocates and policymakers have suggested other ways government could address the looming rental housing crisis.The approach partially adopted by the CARES Act is to compensate displaced workers for their loss of income. This could be expanded through repeated cash payments to households. Alternatively, unemployment benefits could be increased. But there is also no guarantee that recipients will use the funds for housing or that funds would be targeted at low-income households that require assistance.The government could pay employers to keep workers on their payroll and hire back those they have let go. It has already adopted this approach to an extent, but not anywhere close to the scale that would be necessary. Scaling up these efforts would probably take months and may not be politically feasible. Vouchers for successWe believe a more viable option would be expanding the government’s Housing Choice Voucher program. Established in 1974, it enables low-income households to rent housing in the private market, paying no more than 30% of their income on rent, with the government paying the rest. It is available to all low-income households and currently serves 2.2 million households – although as many as 10 million were eligible for the program before the COVID crisis.The program already has the administrative apparatus needed to handle an increase in participants: a nationwide network of over 3,300 housing authorities with decades of experience. Many have already demonstrated their capacity to dramatically expand operations to accommodate new households in the event of natural disasters, such as hurricanes and floods.If expanded to meet the demands of the current crisis, the Housing Choice Voucher program could act as a shock absorber for the rental housing market. For tenants, it would provide some stability where there now is uncertainty and reduce the risk of displacement, eviction and homelessness. For landlords, it would provide a steady stream of income to help pay the mortgage, property taxes and other expenses.[Get facts about coronavirus and the latest research.

Andrew Cuomo said Wednesday that while local officials may “feel political pressure�? to lift shelter-in-place restrictions amid the coronavirus pandemic, he refuses to open up his virus-stricken state until steps are in place to avoid a second wave of the disease.“I get the pressure, but we can’t make a bad decision. Frankly, this is no time to act stupidly. Period. I don’t know how else to say it,&amp;quot; Cuomo said at a press conference in Albany, adding that the decision to reopen New York’s economy should be based on “facts�? and not “political pressure.�? “I’m not going to have the political obituary of this era be, well, they acted imprudently.�?Cuomo’s warning came as protesters gathered at New York’s state capitol to demonstrate against the stay-at-home order in place until at least May 15. The demonstration follows several protests in defiance of social-distancing guidelines that have erupted nationwide against public health orders to stay at home and close down non-essential businesses.Cuomo Praises Trump Target on His Way to Oval Office MeetingHe added that while residents may be feeling “cabin fever,�? reopening the state prematurely—and without the coordination of neighboring states—would set back any progress the Empire State has seen in flattening the curve of the virus. Addressing the protesters outside the capitol, Cuomo said, “The illness is death. What’s worse than that? This isn’t just about you... It’s about we.�? He half-jokingly added that if New Yorkers are so desperate to work amid the virus, they should “go get a job as an essential worker.�?To date, 15,302 residents have died and 258,589 more have been infected by the coronavirus across the state, Cuomo said. Despite those devastating numbers, the daily death toll across the state has dramatically decreased, with 474 deaths overnight, indicating a “gentle decline.�? The rate of hospitalizations and ICU admissions have also decreased. As officials across the nation are shifting their attention to reopening states’ economies after COVID-19, Cuomo said that diagnostic testing continues to be critical in determining when, and how, individuals will return to work. Cuomo said that New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut will launch a “nation-leading contact-tracing program,�? that will track down residents who may have been exposed or infected, and then trace those they may have been in contact with to contain the spread. Cuomo: It’s Time to Start ‘Reimagining’ What Life Will Be in New York After COVID-19 Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg volunteered to help the state develop a testing-tracing-isolation program along with Johns Hopkins University and Vital Strategies, Cuomo said.Mayor Bill de Blasio also announced New York City’s initiative to help the state “test and trace�? the virus, saying that city officials are striving to have widespread testing available in every community. Those who test positive will then be given care “right away,�? and if they’re unable to isolate properly, they will be placed in hotel rooms across the five boroughs. “We’ll get you the help you need. The whole idea is to help you to isolate to get well, to have the support you need, and of course, get tested again to know when you’re done with the disease so you can go back to your regular life,�? de Blasio said. Cuomo on Wednesday also spoke about his “productive�? meeting with President Donald Trump at the White House.“To me, a productive visit means we spoke the truth. We spoke facts. We made decisions, and we have a plan going forward. And that was accomplished yesterday. And I feel good about it personally,�? Cuomo said.‘Clearly Spoiling for a Fight’: Cuomo Says Pandemic Is More Important Than Trump FeudDuring the meeting, Cuomo said Trump committed to helping the state double its diagnostic and antibody testing to 40,00 tests a day.“By the way, these are people in the White House who, politically, don&amp;#39;t like me. You know, that&amp;#39;s the fact, right? You see the president&amp;#39;s tweets. He&amp;#39;s often tweeted very unkind things about me and my brother,�? Cuomo said. “We’ve had conflicts back and forth. But we sat with him. We sat with his team. And that was put aside. Because who really cares how I feel or how he feels? Who cares?

The next day, Amazon pulled the additional items that he had listed from its retail platform, along with those of thousands of other sellers.&amp;quot;Disrupting necessary supplies during an unprecedented pandemic is a serious offense,&amp;quot; Herbert H.

Lee, a lawyer for the brothers, said in an email Wednesday that his clients had agreed to donate all the supplies to their church for distribution to local emergency responders before the state began its investigation. He said the brothers appreciated the swift resolution of the matter.Matt Colvin, a former Air Force technical sergeant, said last month that he had received hate mail and death threats after The Times published an article about the stockpile.In Tennessee, a state price-gouging law prohibits individuals or businesses from charging &amp;quot;unreasonable&amp;quot; prices for essential goods or services in direct response to a disaster, whether it occurs in the state or elsewhere.Under the settlement terms, the brothers agreed not to engage in any further price gouging during the coronavirus health crisis.A week after the brothers first made headlines, President Donald Trump signed an executive order that directed the Justice Department to investigate and prosecute cases of price gouging and hoarding of critical supplies that included face masks and sanitizing products.Last month, a Brooklyn man was charged with lying to federal agents about price gouging. The authorities said the man, Baruch Feldheim, 43, had stockpiled 192,000 N95 respirators, 130,000 surgical masks and nearly 600,000 medical-grade gloves, which were redirected to medical workers in New York and New Jersey.This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2020 The New York Times Company&lt;p&gt;&lt;br clear="all"&gt;</description>

            <title>A $6 Billion Windfall: Mexico&amp;#39;s Massive Oil Hedge Is Paying Off</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.yahoo.com/6-billion-windfall-mexicos-massive-152046487.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://l2.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Nvpca00vXcFR4.Qj3XYwVA--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/f072dd09906f1bb8844629bded745a61" width="130" height="86" alt="A $6 Billion Windfall: Mexico&amp;#39;s Massive Oil Hedge Is Paying Off" align="left" title="A $6 Billion Windfall: Mexico&amp;#39;s Massive Oil Hedge Is Paying Off" border="0" &gt;&lt;/a&gt;(Bloomberg) -- Mexico is on track to cash in on a $6 billion windfall once its massive insurance program against low oil prices kicks in following a dramatic plunge in prices, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Wednesday.For the past two decades, Mexico has locked in its oil revenue via put options it buys from a small group of investment banks and oil companies in what’s considered Wall Street’s largest -- and most closely guarded -- annual oil deal.The options give Mexico the right to sell its oil at a predetermined price. They are the equivalent of an insurance policy: the country banks all gains from a rally but enjoys the security of a minimum floor. So if oil remains weak or plunges even further, Mexico will still book higher prices.“We protected the Ministry of Finance,�? Lopez Obrador said in Mexico City. “We insured an oil price of $49 a barrel. The hedge will allow us to obtain about 150 billion pesos. We won’t lose money due to the oil-price drop.�?The 150 billion translates to about $6.2 billion at current exchange rates, according to a calculation by Bloomberg News.The hedge has shielded Mexico in every downturn over the last 20 years: it made $5.1 billion when prices crashed in 2009 during the global financial crisis, and it received $6.4 billion in 2015 and another $2.7 billion in 2016 after Saudi Arabia waged a price war.Hedge CostThe operation comes at a cost. In recent years, the nation has spent about $1 billion annually buying the options. Although Mexico in the past disclosed information about its hedge, over the last year it has declared the program a state secret to avoid hedge funds and other speculators trying to profit from it.“The insurance policy isn’t cheap,�? Mexico’s Finance Minister Arturo Herrera told broadcaster Televisa on March 10. “But it’s insurance for times like now. Our fiscal budget isn’t going to be hit.�?Mexico hasn’t disclosed who sold it the put options that the country used to hedge its 2020 oil risk. In the past, it has used some of the top names in Wall Street, including Goldman Sachs Group and JPMorgan &amp; Chase Co., plus the in-house trading arms of big oil companies such as Royal Dutch Shell Plc.The Mexican government told lawmakers earlier this year it has guaranteed revenues to support the assumptions for oil prices made in the country’s budget -- $49 a barrel for the Mexican oil export basket, equivalent to about $60-$65 a barrel for Brent crude. The Mexican oil basket fell on Tuesday to $7.12 a barrel.Mexico locks its crude revenue via two elements: the hedge, and the country’s oil stabilization fund. The fund historically has only provided $2-$5 a barrel, so it’s realistic to assume that Mexico hedged at around $45 a barrel, at least, for its crude. In the past, the country has hedged around 250 million barrels, equal to nearly all its net oil exports in an operation that runs from Dec. 1 to Nov. 30.On top of its sovereign oil hedge, which is run by the country’s Ministry of Finance and executed by the central bank, the state-owned oil company Petroleos Mexicanos also runs a much smaller oil hedge.(Updates in ninth paragraph with details of previous counterparties.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br clear="all"&gt;</description>

            <title>&amp;#39;Like the horror of war&amp;#39;: mayor of virus-ravaged Ecuador city calls for drastic response</title>

She died there on 13 March.A failure to properly enforce social distancing in the weeks after coronavirus arrived is also suspected to have played a role.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br clear="all"&gt;</description>

She died there on 13 March.A failure to properly enforce social distancing in the weeks after coronavirus arrived is also suspected to have played a role.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br clear="all"&gt;</media:text>

Shortages were initially limited to imported fruit and vegetables and then moved on to other goods, it said.Radio Free Asia also reported last week that the prices of food staples in North Korea were rising sharply because of panic buying.North Korea closed its borders in January when coronavirus cases in neighboring China began to skyrocket. Kim’s regime has said it has no confirmed infections from the virus but the U.S. is “fairly certain�? it has cases because of a noticeable lack of military activity, General Robert Abrams, commander of U.S. Forces Korea, told reporters in a teleconference briefing in March.Food shortages are common in North Korea, which is one of the world’s poorest states. In the 1990s, a famine killed as much as 10% of the population, according to some estimates.The virus could make things worse.

He has not been seen since a politburo meeting on April 11, raising speculation about his condition.The state-run Korean Central News Agency reported that Kim on Wednesday sent a message to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Letters of this sort are reported frequently.U.S. officials said Monday they were told Kim was in critical condition after undergoing cardiovascular surgery last week and they were unsure of his current health. Meanwhile, South Korean President Moon Jae-in’s office said that Kim was conducting “normal activities�? in a rural part of the country assisted by close aides and no special movements were detected.The health of North Korea’s leader is one of the most closely guarded secrets in the isolated state, known only to a few people in its inner circle. U.S. President Donald Trump said Tuesday he doesn’t know about Kim’s health, adding that he might reach out to check on him.General John Hyten, the vice chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in Washington on Wednesday he couldn’t confirm or deny the reports, adding “I assume that Kim Jong-un is still in full control of the Korean nuclear forces and the Korean military forces.
